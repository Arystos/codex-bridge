Use [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) from [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) for code review, task delegation, and second opinions — over MCP, using your existing Codex subscription. No API key required.

> **Two models rarely make the same mistake.** skill-codex lets Claude and Codex check each other's work — Claude plans and builds fast, Codex reviews with fresh eyes — from a single terminal. No API key, no second window, no copy-paste.

## Why?

Claude Code and Codex CLI have different strengths. Claude excels at reasoning, architecture, and complex refactors. Codex is fast, thorough, and great at focused execution and review. **skill-codex** lets them work together from a single terminal — no second window, no copy-paste, no context loss.

* **`/codex-review`** — Codex reviews your current changes; Claude then audits each finding against the code (keep / rewrite / drop / new, with evidence) before the verdict, so false positives are filtered and missed issues surfaced
* **`/codex-do`** — delegate well-scoped implementation tasks to Codex
* **`/codex-consult`** — get a second opinion on architecture or design decisions
* **`codex-bridge` agent skill** — auto-triggers on implementation/review/consult requests, no command needed
* **Auto-review hook** — a smart PostToolUse hook suggests review after significant changes
* **Live progress** — streams Codex's activity as MCP progress so long runs never look frozen (mirrored to a tail-able log under the OS temp dir — never pollutes your repo)
* **Subscription-first** — works with `codex login`, no `OPENAI_API_KEY` needed
* **Guardrails** — retry, timeout, anti-recursion, lock files, pre-flight checks

### Why not just use Claude's own subagents?

Because a subagent is the **same model**. When Claude reviews Claude, you inherit the same blind spots — it's grading its own homework. A *different* model family was trained differently, so its mistakes don't correlate with Claude's: it catches what Claude is confidently wrong about, and Claude catches what Codex gets wrong. That uncorrelated, cross-model check is the entire point — and skill-codex keeps Claude as the final judge, never blindly forwarding Codex's verdict.

### How it compares

| | skill-codex | Most Codex MCP bridges |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** verified in CI (not just "should work") | ✅ 9-way matrix (Windows/macOS/Linux × Node 18/20/22) | ❌ usually Linux-only CI |
| Works around Codex's **elevated-sandbox spawn bug** (no WSL needed) | ✅ pins `windows.sandbox=unelevated` | ❌ |
| **Live progress** so long runs never look frozen | ✅ MCP progress + tail-able log | ⚠️ varies |
| **Slash commands** (`/codex-review`, `/codex-do`, `/codex-consult`) | ✅ | ⚠️ some |
| **Auto-review hook** (PostToolUse) | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Agent skill** (auto-triggers, no command needed) | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Guardrails**: retry, timeout, anti-recursion, lock files | ✅ | ⚠️ partial |
| Codex **subscription** auth (`codex login`, no `OPENAI_API_KEY`) | ✅ | ✅ table stakes — the official Codex MCP & OpenAI plugin do this too |

*A snapshot, not a leaderboard — the Codex MCP space moves fast, so check each tool's current state. Subscription auth (no API key) is **table stakes**: the official Codex MCP server and OpenAI's own plugin use your `codex login` too, so it's not a differentiator — it's just reassurance you won't get a metered API bill. Where skill-codex actually focuses is the operational details: real, CI-verified Windows support (incl. the elevated-sandbox bug), never-frozen runs, guardrails, and an act-on-it review workflow.*

## Install

**Prerequisites**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 18
* [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) installed and authenticated
* [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and logged in (`codex login`)

**Quick start**

```shell
# Option A: run directly (no global install)
npx skill-codex setup

# Option B: install globally, then setup
npm i -g skill-codex
skill-codex setup

# Restart Claude Code to load the MCP server, then use:
/codex-review              # Review uncommitted changes
/codex-do "write tests"    # Delegate a task to Codex
/codex-consult "approach?" # Get a second opinion
```

`setup` registers the MCP server (`~/.claude.json`), installs the slash commands (`~/.claude/commands/`), configures the auto-review hook, installs the `codex-bridge` agent skill (`~/.claude/skills/`), and verifies everything.

> **Tip:** add `.skill-codex.lock` to your `.gitignore`.

**Install as a plugin instead**

```shell
/plugin marketplace add Arystos/skill-codex
/plugin install skill-codex@skill-codex
```

The plugin bundles the MCP server (launched via `npx -y skill-codex mcp`), the slash commands, the agent skill, and the auto-review hook. Restart Claude Code after installing.

## Usage

```
You in Claude Code
  |
  |-- /codex-review        --> MCP tool --> codex exec --sandbox read-only       --> review findings
  |-- /codex-do "task"     --> MCP tool --> codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --> reviewed output
  +-- /codex-consult "q"   --> MCP tool --> codex exec --sandbox read-only       --> synthesized opinion
```

The MCP server spawns `codex exec` as a subprocess using your logged-in Codex session. Claude sees the output and critically evaluates it — **Codex is treated as a peer, not an authority**.

The slash commands are explicit entry points; the `codex-bridge` **agent skill** is the implicit one — Claude loads it automatically when your request matches a delegation, review, or consult pattern ("implement X", "review this diff", "second opinion on…"). Trivial tasks (< 50 lines, faster done directly) are out of scope.

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced: model, effort, sandbox, sessions &amp; native review</b></summary>

These `codex_exec` parameters are all optional — omit them and Codex uses its defaults:

* **`model`** — pick the Codex model (e.g. `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`). Route cheap tasks to a smaller model and escalate hard ones.
* **`reasoningEffort`** — how hard Codex thinks: `minimal` | `low` | `medium` | `high` | `xhigh`.
* **`sandbox`** — explicit policy (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`), overriding `mode`. Use `danger-full-access` only when you understand the risk.
* **`sessionId`** — resume a previous Codex session for multi-round memory. Each response includes the session's thread id; pass it back so Codex retains context — e.g. a follow-up review that checks whether *previously flagged* issues were fixed.
* **`review`** — run Codex's native diff-scoped reviewer (`codex exec review`), optionally targeting a branch (`reviewBase`) or commit (`reviewCommit`).

## Configuration

Everything is optional. The most common knobs:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SKILL_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` (5 min) | Subprocess timeout |
| `SKILL_CODEX_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retry count for transient errors |
| `SKILL_CODEX_WINDOWS_SANDBOX` | `unelevated` | Windows-only Codex sandbox mode |

The auto-review hook skips trivial diffs (docs-only, < 5 lines, whitespace) and forces review on security paths or large/cross-cutting changes, to preserve your Codex quota.

**Full reference** — all env vars, the complete smart-filter rules, edge-case behavior, and every `codex_exec` parameter: **[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)**.

## Troubleshooting

**Setup says "Hook script not found"** — run `npm run build` first, then `npx skill-codex setup` again. The hook scripts live in the package root, not in `dist/`.

**`/codex-review` says "Unknown tool: codex_exec"** — restart Claude Code after setup. The MCP server only loads on startup.

**Codex keeps timing out** — increase it: `export SKILL_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS=1200000` (20 min). Large codebases take longer.

**"Auth expired" but Codex works in another terminal** — the MCP server runs in its own process. Run `codex login` and restart Claude Code. On Windows the auth pre-check is skipped automatically (PowerShell profile errors cause false negatives); auth is still verified when Codex actually runs.

**Lock file blocking runs** — a crashed run can leave a stale `.skill-codex.lock`. It auto-cleans after 15 minutes, or delete it manually.

**Windows: "windows sandbox failed: spawn setup refresh" / Codex commands all blocked** — Codex's default *elevated* Windows sandbox fails to spawn shells on many setups ([openai/codex#24098](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/24098), [#24259](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/24259)). skill-codex pins `windows.sandbox=unelevated`, which spawns reliably. If your machine needs the elevated sandbox, set `SKILL_CODEX_WINDOWS_SANDBOX=elevated`.

## Security scanning (SkillSpector)

**Verdict:** NVIDIA SkillSpector v2.3.13 currently reports **100/100, CRITICAL, DO NOT INSTALL** for this repo even though there are **zero CRITICAL findings**. That verdict is expected here: the score is saturated by the remaining HIGH findings, so fixing the resolved dependency issue did not move the verdict. Do not read the score as proof that a critical vulnerability remains, and do not read the baseline as a clean bill of health.

```shell
skillspector scan . --no-llm
skillspector scan . --baseline .skillspector-baseline.yaml --no-llm
skillspector scan . --baseline .skillspector-baseline.yaml --no-llm --show-suppressed
```

**LLM mode:** `--no-llm` matters. Without it, SkillSpector attempts LLM analysis and needs provider credentials such as `NVIDIA_INFERENCE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

| Scan | Findings | Suppressed | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Fresh clone, raw | 53 | 0 | 100/100, CRITICAL, DO NOT INSTALL |
| Fresh clone, with baseline | 50 | 3 | 100/100, CRITICAL, DO NOT INSTALL |
| Built working copy, raw | 72 | 0 | 100/100, CRITICAL, DO NOT INSTALL |
| Built working copy, with baseline | 50 | 22 | 100/100, CRITICAL, DO NOT INSTALL |

**Baseline:** Baselined scans converge on 50 findings regardless of build state. `dist/` and `coverage/` are gitignored, so they exist only in a locally built copy and duplicate source findings. The baseline suppresses only `dist/**`, `coverage/**`, and `eval/corpus/**` - never `src/`, `setup/`, or `bin/`. Product code stays visible on purpose so the scan remains auditable rather than laundered; run `--show-suppressed` to verify the suppressed paths and written reasons rather than trusting this summary.

**Remaining findings:** The severity mix is **14 HIGH, 26 MEDIUM, 10 LOW**. All 14 HIGH findings are verified false positives:

| Rule | Location | Why it is not a product vulnerability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AS1 | `setup/setup.ts:110,137` | Reads `~/.claude/settings.json`; that is the product's installer configuring the PostToolUse hook. |
| RA1 | `bin/skill-codex.ts:29,84`; `src/errors/errors.ts:126` | Matches `--help` usage text and an error-message string. |
| TM1/TM2 | `__tests__/runner/progress.test.ts:30,32`; `__tests__/tools/codex-exec.test.ts:291` | Test fixtures contain `rm -rf /` and `model: "x;rm -rf"` to prove the runner reports blocked commands and rejects invalid input. |
| TM1 | `package-lock.json` | Matches a lockfile string. |
| AS1/TM1/TM2 | `README.md` (this section) | Self-referential: documenting the fixtures above means quoting them, so this very section trips the same string detectors. Four HIGH findings exist only because the docs explain the false positives. |

Also present at MEDIUM: `TM3` on `src/guards/preflight.ts:12,33`, matching the parameter names `skipAuth` and `skipLock`. Both are optional and default falsy, so the checks run by default.

**Dependency status:** `SC4` is fixed and gone: there are now zero SC4 findings and zero CRITICAL findings. The dependency work was `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `^1.26.0` -> `^1.29.0`, `vitest` `^2.0.0` -> `^3.2.7`, `@vitest/coverage-v8` `^2.0.0` -> `^3.2.7`, and `tsup` `^8.0.0` -> `^8.5.1`. `npm audit` went from 15 vulnerabilities, including 2 critical, to 1 low. The remaining low is `esbuild` pinned transitively by `tsup`; it is build tooling, is never shipped, and is unreachable here because nothing runs an esbuild dev server.

**SC4 nuance:** SkillSpector reads the declared semver range floor in `package.json`, not the resolved version in `package-lock.json`. It reported `vitest==3.2.4` from `^3.2.4`, so the declared floors were raised to versions that are themselves non-vulnerable - OSV reports CVE-2026-47429 affects `vitest <3.2.6`, and CVE-2024-53384 affects `tsup <=8.3.4` - rather than relying on the lockfile alone.

*(Counts are a SkillSpector v2.3.13 snapshot and will shift as the scanner and dependencies change. Re-run the commands above rather than trusting these numbers.)*
