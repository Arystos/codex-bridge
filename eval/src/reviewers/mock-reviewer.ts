/**
 * MOCK reviewer — for testing the HARNESS PLUMBING ONLY. It produces NO real
 * review and is NOT a measurement of any model. Its findings are derived from
 * shallow, language-agnostic heuristics over the diff text, plus an explicit
 * `blindSpots` set of categories it pretends to "miss". This lets us:
 *   - exercise every code path (caught / missed / false-positive / verdict),
 *   - demonstrate a single-model vs cross-model DELTA in `npm run eval`,
 * WITHOUT making paid model calls and WITHOUT reading the answer key.
 *
 * Crucially, the mock NEVER inspects case.bug / expectedSignals — it only sees
 * the diff text and its own configured rules. The numbers it produces are
 * therefore a property of these toy rules, not a claim about Claude or Codex.
 * Real numbers come from the live reviewer (see live-reviewer.ts + README).
